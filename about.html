            <h2>My Personal interests</h2>
            <p>My name is Christian and I really enjoy disecting movies, books, and anime. I like kind of immersing myself in the stories that are told and learning about the different characters. Understanding why the characters do what they do and what kind of worlds they are in is something that just kind of facinates me. I also really love to see all of the different ways that a movie is shot or if it's an anime all the different art styles are awesome!!</p>
            <p>Something else that I am interested in is listening to music. My top 3 favorite generes are metal, rap, and indie, these generes just have a lot of really great artists like Corey Taylor, Kendrick Lamar, or x The only kind of music I don't go out of my way to listen to is country music not a super big fan of it. It is also really fun finding new artists and watching them grow a fanbase and going to concerts is also really awesome. </p>
            <p>Martial arts is another big part of my life I have been practicing for a little over 3 years. It is a way to kind of express myself and train my body, I have met a lot of really awesome teachers and people because of it. I also really enjoy the history of martial arts and seeing different styles all evolve and change with the times</p>
